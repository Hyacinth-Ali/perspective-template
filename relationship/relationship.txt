Uses (Needs it): Model elements from model A refer to model elements of B.
Multiplicity constraints can handle it?

Extends (Don't Need it): This is a relationship where model elements of model A extend
model elements of model B. A and B conform to the same metamodel. Or, we can use
it in a multi-role single-language perspective. Design class extends Domain class
Multiplicity constraints can handle it?

Refines (Needs it): Model element of Model A refines another model element in B model.
In this case, the A element captures more concrete design decision about B element.
E.g., class diagram refines operation
Multiplicity constraints can handle it?

Complements: Model A and Model B describe two different views of the same
system and possibly include little overlap with each
other.
Equality constraint can handle it.

Alternative For (Needs it): It is similar to Complements, but with more
overlapping.

Aspect Of (Don't need it): Model B captures additional information related
to elements of model A.

Aspects Of: In this case, two model elements have Aspect of relationship
with another element.

Weaves (Don't need it): A weaving model is used to link a number of otherwise unrelated
models.
